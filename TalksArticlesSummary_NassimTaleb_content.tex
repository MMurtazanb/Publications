\begin{itemize}
\item Who, in your field, recognizes you? your peers or the client? If peers, then its Expert Problem.
\item Who recognizes actors? the Film-fare awards (ppl from same fraternity), then not good? but if it goes well on Box office, then the client/public approval, is supreme.
\item (yk): In company, who decides you are better than your neighbor? you peers/boss, then not good. If appreciated by client, who pays you, then its good.
The One who pays, his/her opinion matters.
