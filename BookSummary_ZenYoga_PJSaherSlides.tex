``Introduction To Three Step Rhythmic Breathing(3SRB)''

\begin{itemize}
\item Death is a technical impossibility
\item We have no control internally. Many centers are producing impulses. Most of the organ functioning is autonomous
\item Thus we cannot control mind, but we have to bring them to rhythm, balance.
\item As per Pantanjali, daily, out of 13k impulses 120 go to brain. Rest are used to keep system working. Out of 120 to brain, 12 are per second, Only one becomes a thought. This just one more theory. May ignore. Just a model.
\item We are interpreting life our way and not how it is
\end{itemize}
