      \begin{itemize}
		\item Problem: While distributing a cake between two brothers, the younger feels that the elder one is cutting into unequal chunks and taking the bigger piece.
		\item Core Issue: Division and Allocation is done by same person.
		\item Solution: Separate both. Meaning, one of them cuts the cake and the other picks. So, almost no chance that the one who divides will make unequal pieces!!
