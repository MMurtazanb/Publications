\frametitle{To make money \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item You basically get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and it doesnâ€™t know how to get elsewhere.
\item You need:
\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Knowledge: that only you know or only a small set of people know.
\item Accountability/Brand: you want to be known as the person who can deliver that.
\item Leverage/Amplification/Multiplier-effect: You need to have ways to scale your work without you and get paid passively.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Why: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale
\item You can stand out of the crowd and get paid sustain-ably iff you have Specific Knowledge.
\item  Much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{What: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is not trainable (else others can get trained and then you get reduced to margin play. It no more remains ``mine'. ONLY I CAN DO)
\item Must Scale
\item Is Passive income (Earns while you are sleeping. if you are getting paid for renting your time then thats not Specific Knowledge as it cannot scale)
\item Has Leverage (ie amplification ie once created earns multiple times based on scale)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{How: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Genuine curiosity
\item Building judgment in a specific domain. Have intuition built. Been there done that type confidence.
\item Experiment in your field. Gain expertize by doing. The failures are learnings too, for which you can get paid.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{What: Leverage}
Types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Labor: someone else working for you and expanding your work. (Difficult)
\item Capital: Expand by putting more money, systems.
\item Products that have no marginal cost of replication: books, media, movies, and code.
\end{itemize}
