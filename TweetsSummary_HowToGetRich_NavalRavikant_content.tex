\frametitle{1. Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep; software running continuously and earning commission per transaction, money invested in mutual funds growing up, house rent, etc.
\item Wealth buys your freedom.

\item Money is how we transfer wealth
\item Status is your rank in the social hierarchy
\begin{itemize}
\item Money is not going to solve all of your problems; but it’s going to solve all of your {\it money} problems.
\item Those who are not able to make money, play game of virtue, called {\it status}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Money is not going to solve all of your problems; but it’s going to solve all of your {\it money} problems.
\item Those who are not able to make money, play game of virtue, called {\it status}
\item Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Everybody in the world can have a house. My having house does not mean that you can not. But not in case of stock purchase. If some has made money in stock, someone else has lost it.
\item Status, on the other hand, is a zero-sum game. When someone is number one then the other has to be number two or lower. Both can not be number one. To be the winner, there must be a loser. That's status.
\item People creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{2. Make Abundance for the World}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wealth isn’t about taking something from somebody else
\item Ethical wealth creation makes abundance for the world
\item Money has been historically treated as evil, because you would take/snatch money from others. Some were rich by taking work from poor. Exploitation. 
\item People got money from others by a sword, or a gun, or taxes, or crony capitalism, or Communism. Like Parasites living off a tree.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item At least in the developed countries, everyone is basically richer than almost anyone who was alive 200 years ago
\item We all have vehicles, medicines, food, etc.
\item ``Today, I would rather be a poor person in a First World country, than be a rich person in Louis the XIV's France''
\item In 20 years from now, most of the things would be automated. Basics are taken care. A Massive abundance.
\item We would do only creative pursuits.

\frametitle{3. Free Markets Are Intrinsic to Humans}
\begin{itemize}
\item Capitalism [meaning free markets] is intrinsic to the human species. 
\item We cooperate. It’s because we can keep track of debits and credits. Who put in how much work? Who contributed how much? That’s all free market capitalism is.
\item We cant do all. So we cooperate and get what we don't make/do. We all have opportunity to produce/offer to others
\item Too many takers and not enough makers will plunge a society into ruin
\iteam Ideal: free minds, and free markets. Small-scale exchange between humans that's voluntary,
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{4. Making Money Isn't About Luck}
\begin{itemize}

\item Luck should not be factor of your success at all.
\item Four types of Luck:
\begin{itemize}
\item Blind Luck: Like fortune, fate, comes without any control.
\item From Hustling (``fortune favors he brave''): Through persistence, hard work, hustle. Trying lots of things so that you get something.
\item From Preparation (``chance favors prepared mind''): Be very skilled in the field, you get better sense where fortune is.
\item From Unique Character: Because of unique/rare ability you go at such places where there is treasure, which no one can find.
\end{itemize}
\item Wealth stacks up one chip at a time, not all at once

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{8. Give Society What It Doesn’t Know How to Get}
\begin{itemize}
\item Society will pay you for creating what it wants and delivering it at scale
\item Figure out what product you can provide and then figure out how to scale it
\item Steve Jobs figured out Smart Phone.
\item Its starts with the rich, like chauffeur driven cars, then with Uber platform, everyone has a chauffeur driven car. At scale.
\item ``Entrepreneurship is essentially an act of creating something new from scratch. Predicting that society will want it, and then figuring out how to scale it, and get it to everybody in a profitable way, in a self-sustaining way.''

\frametitle{12. Partner With Rational Optimists}
\begin{itemize}
\item Don't partner with cynics and pessimists; their beliefs are self-fulfilling.
\item We’re genetically hardwired to be pessimists. But modern society is far, far safer. There are no tigers wandering around the street.
\item To create things, you have to be a rational optimist. Rational in the sense that you have to see the world for what it really is. And yet you have to be optimistic about your own capabilities, and your capability to get things done.
\item``Either lead, follow, or get out of the way.'' Some people have 4th option: They want to tell you why the thing is not going to work.

\frametitle{13. Arm Yourself With Specific Knowledge}
To make money \ldots
\begin{itemize}
\item You basically get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and it doesn’t know how to get elsewhere.

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Knowledge: that only you know or only a small set of people know.

\item Leverage/Amplification/Multiplier-effect: You need to have ways to scale your work without you and get paid passively.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Why: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale
\item You can stand out of the crowd and get paid sustain-ably iff you have Specific Knowledge.
\item  Much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{What: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is not trainable (else others can get trained and then you get reduced to margin play. It no more remains ``mine'. ONLY I CAN DO)
\item Must Scale
\item Is Passive income (Earns while you are sleeping. if you are getting paid for renting your time then thats not Specific Knowledge as it cannot scale)
\item Has Leverage (ie amplification ie once created earns multiple times based on scale)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{How: Specific Knowledge}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{16. Read What You Love Until You Love to Read}
\begin{itemize}
\item You should be able to pick up any book in the library and read it
\item Avoid business magazines and business class, study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics and computers.
\item ``reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching.''
\item Read the original scientific books in a field. Adam Smith’s The Wealth of Nations. Darwin’s Origin of the Species.
\item Don't fear any book. Pick up any book and have ability to absorb, retain good stuff and reject the bad.

\frametitle{17. The Foundations Are Math and Logic}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mathematics and logic are the basis for understanding everything else
\item Foundational things are principles, they’re algorithms.
\item It's better to read a great book slowly than to fly through a hundred books quickly.
\item Understanding comes through repetition, usage,logic and foundations that really makes you a smart thinker.
\item Learn persuasion and programming.
\item Need deep understanding of some complex topic.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{18. There’s No Actual Skill Called `Business'}
\begin{itemize}
\item Avoid business schools and magazines
\item ``Case studies'' are just anecdotes, stories. They are other people's situations. Your stuff is different. You will understand them only when you go through them in real life.
\item Doing is faster than watching or listening. You cant change speed too much. You can not go back. Hard to highlight, save to notebooks, etc.
\item The number of `doing' iterations drives the learning curve. But not repetition of same things. Iterations are upgrades every time. New weights after learning from back-propagation. Changed approach every time.
\item If you're willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later
\end{itemize}
