\frametitle{1. Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep; software running continuously and earning commission per transaction, money invested in mutual funds growing up, house rent, etc.
\item Wealth buys your freedom.

\item Money is how we transfer wealth
\item Status is your rank in the social hierarchy
\begin{itemize}
\item Money is not going to solve all of your problems; but it’s going to solve all of your {\it money} problems.
\item Those who are not able to make money, play game of virtue, called {\it status}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item Money is not going to solve all of your problems; but it’s going to solve all of your {\it money} problems.
\item Those who are not able to make money, play game of virtue, called {\it status}
\item Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Everybody in the world can have a house. My having house does not mean that you can not. But not in case of stock purchase. If some has made money in stock, someone else has lost it.
\item Status, on the other hand, is a zero-sum game. When someone is number one then the other has to be number two or lower. Both can not be number one. To be the winner, there must be a loser. That's status.
\item People creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{2. Make Abundance for the World}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wealth is not finite. Or else, we all would be in caves, dividing fire wood.
\item Most of the wealth in civilization has been created.
\begin{itemize}
\item Got created from somewhere. 
\item Got created from people. 
\item Got created from technology. 
\item Got created from productivity. 
\item Got created from hard work.
\end{itemize}
\item Everyone can be rich
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{2. Make Abundance for the World}
\begin{itemize}
\item Wealth isn’t about taking something from somebody else
\item Ethical wealth creation makes abundance for the world
\item Money has been historically treated as evil, because you would take/snatch money from others. Some were rich by taking work from poor. Exploitation. 
\item People got money from others by a sword, or a gun, or taxes, or crony capitalism, or Communism. Like Parasites living off a tree.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{2. Make Abundance for the World}
\begin{itemize}
\item At least in the developed countries, everyone is basically richer than almost anyone who was alive 200 years ago
\item We all have vehicles, medicines, food, etc.
\item ``Today, I would rather be a poor person in a First World country, than be a rich person in Louis the XIV's France''
\item In 20 years from now, most of the things would be automated. Basics are taken care. A Massive abundance.
\item We would do only creative pursuits.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{3. Free Markets Are Intrinsic to Humans}
\begin{itemize}
\item Capitalism [meaning free markets] is intrinsic to the human species. 
\item We cooperate. It’s because we can keep track of debits and credits. Who put in how much work? Who contributed how much? That’s all free market capitalism is.
\item We cant do all. So we cooperate and get what we don't make/do. We all have opportunity to produce/offer to others
\item Too many takers and not enough makers will plunge a society into ruin
\iteam Ideal: free minds, and free markets. Small-scale exchange between humans that's voluntary,
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{To make money \ldots}
\begin{itemize}
\item You basically get rewarded by society for giving it what it wants and it doesn’t know how to get elsewhere.
\item You need:
\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Knowledge: that only you know or only a small set of people know.
\item Accountability/Brand: you want to be known as the person who can deliver that.
\item Leverage/Amplification/Multiplier-effect: You need to have ways to scale your work without you and get paid passively.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Why: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item If you want to make money you have to get paid at scale
\item You can stand out of the crowd and get paid sustain-ably iff you have Specific Knowledge.
\item  Much easier to be top 5 percentile at three or four things than it is to be literally the number one at something
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{What: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is not trainable (else others can get trained and then you get reduced to margin play. It no more remains ``mine'. ONLY I CAN DO)
\item Must Scale
\item Is Passive income (Earns while you are sleeping. if you are getting paid for renting your time then thats not Specific Knowledge as it cannot scale)
\item Has Leverage (ie amplification ie once created earns multiple times based on scale)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{How: Specific Knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
\item Genuine curiosity
\item Building judgment in a specific domain. Have intuition built. Been there done that type confidence.
\item Experiment in your field. Gain expertize by doing. The failures are learnings too, for which you can get paid.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{What: Leverage}
Types:
\begin{itemize}
\item Labor: someone else working for you and expanding your work. (Difficult)
\item Capital: Expand by putting more money, systems.
\item Products that have no marginal cost of replication: books, media, movies, and code.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
